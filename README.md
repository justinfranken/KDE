# Research Module in Econometrics and Statistics

### Topic: Kernel Density Estimation

In this Research Module in Econometrics and Statistics held by Dr. Claudia Noack in the winter-term 2023 we talk about Kernel Density Estimation.

### Reason for this Github repository

We created this repository in order to colaborate to a R.file which is made to simulate and make real data insights possible, using Kernel Density estimation methods.

### Participants:

The authors for this Project are Justin Franken, Torben Haferkamp and Niklas Niedermeier.

### Structure and execution of the project

The results of our Monte-Carlo simulation are generated and saved using the simulations.R script. The script analysis.R reads the already saved results and is used for the interactive visual representation. Both scripts can be found in the scripts folder. 

To generate the results of our real data application, you can run the income_estimation.R script of the real_data_application folder.
